Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship – Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP). The projects involve data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models applied to real-world datasets.

🚀 Projects Overview
Task 1: Unemployment Analysis in India
📂 Dataset: Unemployment in India.xlsx and Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.xlsx
Analyzed unemployment trends across India during COVID-19.
Cleaned and processed data (renamed columns, handled dates).
Visualized unemployment rates by region, area (rural/urban), and time trends.
Built an interactive geo-scatter map using Plotly to show unemployment rates across states with longitude/latitude data.
📊 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Task 2: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
📂 Dataset: spam.xlsx
Preprocessed email dataset by cleaning null values and extracting features.
Applied Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) for text feature extraction.
Trained a Naive Bayes Classifier to classify emails as spam or ham.
Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
📊 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP (CountVectorizer)

Task 3: Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
📂 Dataset: Advertising.xlsx
Analyzed how TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisement budgets affect sales.
Trained a Linear Regression Model to predict sales.
Visualized correlations using heatmaps and regression plots.
Evaluated model performance with R² score and Mean Squared Error.
📊 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
